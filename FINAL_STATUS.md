# Plant Disease Detection System - Final Status

## System Components

✅ **Web Application Server (Node.js/Express)**
- Running on http://localhost:3000
- Handles user interface and image uploads
- Stores results in MongoDB
- Communicates with AI server via API

✅ **AI Server (Python/Flask)**
- Running on http://localhost:5000
- Loaded trained model for plant disease detection
- Processes images and returns predictions
- Uses MobileNetV2 with transfer learning

✅ **Machine Learning Model**
- Successfully trained on plant disease dataset
- Model files generated:
  - `leaf_disease_model.keras` (10.15 MB)
  - `class_names.pkl` (985 bytes)
- Can classify 35 different plant diseases
- Validation accuracy: ~75% (will improve with more epochs)

## How to Use the System

1. **Access the Web Interface**
   - Open your browser to http://localhost:3000

2. **Upload an Image**
   - Click the "Choose File" button to select a plant leaf image
   - Supported formats: JPG, JPEG, PNG

3. **Analyze the Image**
   - Click the "Analyze" button
   - Wait for the AI to process the image (usually 1-2 seconds)

4. **View Results**
   - The system will display the predicted disease and confidence score
   - Results are stored in the MongoDB database

## Technical Details

### Architecture
- Dual-server architecture for separation of concerns
- Node.js handles frontend and user interactions
- Python handles AI inference
- Communication via RESTful API

### AI Model
- Based on MobileNetV2 for efficient inference
- Transfer learning approach for faster training
- Trained on 51,258 images across 35 disease classes
- Validation set of 12,833 images

## Next Steps

1. **Improve Model Accuracy**
   - Train for more epochs to improve accuracy
   - Experiment with different architectures
   - Add data augmentation techniques

2. **Enhance User Interface**
   - Add image preview before upload
   - Show loading progress during analysis
   - Display historical results

3. **Add More Features**
   - Treatment recommendations for detected diseases
   - Multiple image upload support
   - Export results to PDF

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. **Server Not Running**
   - Ensure both servers are started
   - Check for port conflicts (3000 and 5000)
   - Verify all dependencies are installed

2. **AI Predictions Not Working**
   - Check that model files exist in ai-server/
   - Verify the AI server is using the trained model
   - Ensure proper communication between servers

3. **Upload Issues**
   - Check file size limits
   - Verify supported image formats
   - Ensure proper file permissions
