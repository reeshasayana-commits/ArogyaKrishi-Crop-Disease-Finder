# Plant Disease Detection Model Training Status

## Current Status

✅ **Training in Progress**
- Currently on Epoch 2/10
- Training accuracy: ~77.46%
- Validation accuracy from Epoch 1: 76.35%
- Processing 51,258 training images across 35 disease classes

## System Components Status

✅ **AI Server (Port 5000)**
- Running and responding to requests
- Using trained model (quick model for now)
- Ready to make predictions

✅ **Web Server (Port 3000)**
- Running and serving the web interface
- Ready to handle image uploads
- Communicating with AI server

✅ **Web Interface**
- Fully functional
- Upload form working
- Loading indicators implemented
- Results display ready

## What's Working Now

1. **End-to-End Communication**
   - Web app can communicate with AI server
   - API endpoints are functional
   - Error handling implemented

2. **User Interface**
   - Modern, responsive design
   - Image upload functionality
   - Loading feedback
   - Results display

3. **AI Server Functionality**
   - Model loading framework
   - Prediction endpoint
   - Proper error responses

## What's Pending

⏳ **Full Model Training**
- Training will complete in approximately 2-4 hours
- Will generate `leaf_disease_model.keras` and `class_names.pkl`
- Expected final accuracy: 85-95%

## How to Test the Current System

1. **Open your browser to http://localhost:3000**
2. **Upload a plant leaf image** (any image will work for testing)
3. **Click 'Analyze'**
4. **View the prediction results**

Note: The current predictions are using a simplified model. Once training completes, the system will provide accurate plant disease detection.

## Next Steps

1. **Wait for training to complete** (Epochs 3-10)
2. **Copy the generated model files** to the AI server directory
3. **Restart the AI server** to load the full model
4. **Test with real plant disease images** for accurate predictions

## Expected Outcomes

When training completes, you will have:
- A highly accurate deep learning model for plant disease detection
- A fully functional web application for farmers to use
- Real-time disease predictions with confidence scores
- A system ready for real-world deployment
