# Plant Disease Scanner - Implementation Summary

## Project Overview
This project implements a web application designed to help farmers by leveraging AI for crop disease detection. The application allows farmers to upload photos of crop leaves, which are then analyzed by AI models to identify diseases and provide recommendations.

## Architecture Implemented
The system is built with a microservices architecture consisting of two separate servers:

### 1. Main Web Application (Node.js/Express)
- **Technology Stack**: Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB
- **Location**: `plant-disease-scanner/` directory
- **Key Features**:
  - Serve the frontend user interface
  - Handle image uploads from users
  - Store analysis results in MongoDB
  - Act as a proxy between the frontend and AI server
  - Manage user interactions and data flow

### 2. AI Server (Python/Flask)
- **Technology Stack**: Python, Flask
- **Location**: `ai-server/` directory
- **Key Features**:
  - Run machine learning models for disease detection
  - Process image data using computer vision
  - Return AI predictions to the main web app
  - Handle model loading and inference pipeline

## Current Implementation Status

### ✅ Completed Components

1. **Node.js Web Server**:
   - Express.js server running on port 3000
   - File upload handling with express-fileupload
   - MongoDB integration with Mongoose
   - API endpoint for image analysis (`/api/analyze`)
   - Proper error handling and response formatting

2. **Python AI Server**:
   - Flask server running on port 5000
   - CORS enabled for cross-origin requests
   - Prediction endpoint (`/predict`) that returns mock results
   - Proper JSON response formatting

3. **Frontend Interface**:
   - Clean, modern user interface with the exact title "ArogyaKrishi: Crop Disease Finder"
   - Single image upload form with validation
   - Loading spinner during analysis
   - Result display area showing disease prediction with confidence
   - Responsive design for mobile and desktop

4. **Server Communication**:
   - Node.js server successfully communicates with Python AI server
   - End-to-end workflow tested and working
   - Proper error handling between services

### 🔄 In Progress Components

1. **AI Model Training**:
   - Created training script (`plant-disease-project/train.py`)
   - Script includes data splitting functionality for validation
   - Ready to train with the provided dataset
   - Requires TensorFlow installation to run

2. **Model Integration**:
   - AI server updated to load trained models
   - Preprocessing functions implemented
   - Fallback to mock predictions when models aren't available

### 🔧 Components Needing Setup

1. **Python Dependencies**:
   - TensorFlow needs to be installed for actual model training
   - Scikit-learn for additional ML capabilities
   - Pillow for image processing

2. **MongoDB**:
   - MongoDB needs to be installed and running for data storage
   - Connection string configured in Node.js server

## How to Run the Application

### Prerequisites
1. Node.js and npm installed
2. Python 3.x installed
3. MongoDB installed and running (optional for basic testing)

### Running the Servers

1. **Terminal 1**: Start the AI server
   ```bash
   cd ai-server
   python simple_ai_server.py
   ```

2. **Terminal 2**: Start the web server
   ```bash
   cd plant-disease-scanner
   node server.js
   ```

3. **Browser**: Open http://localhost:3000

### Testing the Communication
Run the test scripts to verify communication:
```bash
python test_communication.py
python test_full_workflow.py
```

## Next Steps for Full Implementation

### 1. Install Python Dependencies
```bash
# Navigate to ai-server directory
cd ai-server
python -m pip install tensorflow flask flask-cors pillow scikit-learn numpy
```

### 2. Train the AI Model
```bash
# Navigate to plant-disease-project directory
cd plant-disease-project
python train.py
```

### 3. Update AI Server to Use Trained Model
Replace [simple_ai_server.py](file://c:\Users\reeshasayana\OneDrive\Desktop\hackathon\plant%20desiase%20scanner\ai-server\simple_ai_server.py) with the updated [ai_server.py](file://c:\Users\reeshasayana\OneDrive\Desktop\hackathon\plant%20desiase%20scanner\ai-server\ai_server.py) that uses the actual trained model.

### 4. Set Up MongoDB
Install and start MongoDB, then ensure the Node.js server can connect to it.
